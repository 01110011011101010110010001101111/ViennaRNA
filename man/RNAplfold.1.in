.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I RNAplfold
computes locally stable RNA secondary structure pair probabilities for a
given window size by computing and averaging over all windows of size L
that can contain a given base pair the probability of said pair. For a sequence of length n and a window size of L the
algorithm uses only O(n+L*L) memory and O(n*L*L) CPU time. Thus it is
practical to "scan" very large genomes for short RNA structures.

Output consists of a dotplot postscript file, where the averaged pair probabilities
can easily be parsed and visually inspected.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
.B \-L span
Set the window Size to span. I.e. no
pairs (i,j) with j\-i>span will be allowed. default = 70
.PP 
.B \-c cutoff
Report only base pairs with an average probability > cutoff default=0.01.
.PP 
The \fB\-T\fP, \fB\-d\fP \fB\-4\fP, \fB\-noGU\fP, \fB\-noCloseGU\fP,
\fB\-e\fP, \fB\-P\fP, \fB\-nsp\fP, options work as in
RNAfold. Most tests were done using "\-d2 \-noLP", other dangling end
settings may still be buggy.

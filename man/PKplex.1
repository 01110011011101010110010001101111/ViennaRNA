       PKplex  reads  RNA  sequences from stdin, calculates their minimum free
       energy (mfe) structure including pseudoknots and prints the mfe  struc-
       ture in bracket notation to stdout.

       It  also  produces a PostScript file with a plot of the pseudoknot-free
       secondary structure graph, in which the bases  forming  the  pseuodknot
       are marked red.

       Sequences are read in a simple text format where each sequence occupies
       a single line. Each sequence may be preceded by a line of the form
       > name
       to assign a name to the sequence. If a name is given in the input, the
        PostScript file "name.ps" is produced for the structure graph.  Other-
       wise  the  file  name defaults to PKplex.ps. Existing files of the same
       name will be overwritten.
       The input format is similar to fasta except that  even  long  sequences
       may  not  be  interrupted  by  line  breaks,  and  the header lines are
       optional.  The program will continue to read new sequences until a line
       consisting  of  the  single  character @ or an end of file condition is
       encountered.

              Energy cutoff or pseudoknot initiation cost. Minimum energy gain
              of  a  pseudoknot interaction for it to be returned. Pseudoknots
              with smaller energy gains are rejected (default=‘-810’).

       --ss,, ----ssuubbooppttss _s_u_b_o_p_t_s
              Print suboptimal structures whose energy difference of the pseu-
              doknot to the optimum  pseudoknot  is  smaller  than  the  given
              value.
              NOTE:  The  final energy of a structure is calculated as the sum
              of the pseudoknot interaction energy, the penalty for initiating
              a  pseudoknot  and the energy of the pseudoknot-free part of the
              structure. The ’-s’ option only takes the pseudoknot interaction
              energy into account, so the final energy differences may be big-
              ger than the specified value (default=‘0’).

       The calculation of mfe structures is based  on  a  dynamic  programming
       algorithm originally developed by M. Zuker and P. Stiegler.  The parti-
       tion function algorithm is based on work by J.S. McCaskill.  The energy
       parameters are taken from:
       D.H.  Mathews,  J.  Sabina,  M.  Zuker and H. Turner "Expanded Sequence
       Dependence of Thermodynamic Parameters Provides  Robust  Prediction  of
       RNA Secondary Structure" JMB, 288, pp 911-940, 1999
